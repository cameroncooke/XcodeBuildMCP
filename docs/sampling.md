# XcodeBuildMCP Sampling

Sampling enables server-initiated autonomous behaviors and recursive LLM interactions for intelligent Xcode operations. This is an advanced MCP feature that requires explicit client support and user consent.

## Overview

Sampling allows the XcodeBuildMCP server to:
- Initiate autonomous debugging workflows
- Perform intelligent error analysis
- Provide proactive build optimization suggestions
- Execute recursive problem-solving interactions

## Current Status

⚠️ **Note:** Sampling capabilities are currently prepared but not fully implemented, as they require:
1. Client support for MCP sampling protocol
2. Explicit user consent for autonomous operations
3. Proper security and safety controls

## Planned Capabilities

### Autonomous Debugging
- **Automated Build Failure Analysis:** Detect build failures and automatically analyze logs to suggest specific fixes
- **Intelligent Error Pattern Recognition:** Learn from common error patterns and provide proactive solutions
- **Smart Dependency Resolution:** Automatically detect and suggest fixes for dependency conflicts

### Proactive Optimization
- **Build Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor build times and suggest optimizations
- **Code Quality Analysis:** Proactively identify code patterns that could lead to issues
- **Resource Usage Optimization:** Monitor and suggest improvements for memory and CPU usage

### Intelligent Assistance
- **Contextual Help:** Provide relevant assistance based on current development context
- **Predictive Problem Solving:** Anticipate potential issues based on code changes
- **Automated Documentation:** Generate and update documentation based on code changes

## Configuration

Sampling is disabled by default and can be enabled with:
```bash
export XCODEBUILDMCP_ENABLE_SAMPLING=true
```

## Security Considerations

When sampling becomes available, it will include:

### User Consent Requirements
- Explicit user approval for each autonomous operation
- Clear explanation of what actions will be taken
- Ability to review and modify suggested actions before execution

### Safety Controls
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Read-only access by default
- Explicit permission required for any modifications
- Audit logging of all autonomous actions

### Privacy Protection
- No automatic data transmission to external services
- Local processing of sensitive project information
- User control over what data can be analyzed

## Future Implementation

The sampling implementation will follow these principles:

### Transparency
- All autonomous actions will be clearly logged
- Users can review the reasoning behind suggestions
- Full audit trail of sampling activities

### Control
- Users maintain full control over autonomous operations
- Granular permissions for different types of actions
- Easy disable/enable controls for specific capabilities

### Safety
- Conservative approach to autonomous modifications
- Extensive testing before any code changes
- Rollback capabilities for all autonomous actions

## Example Use Cases

When implemented, sampling might enable scenarios like:

```typescript
// Autonomous build failure analysis
server.requestSampling({
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: {
        type: 'text',
        text: 'Analyze this build failure and suggest specific fixes.'
      }
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: {
        type: 'text',
        text: `Build failed with: ${buildError}\nProject: ${projectContext}`
      }
    }
  ],
  maxTokens: 1000,
  includeContext: 'thisServer'
});
```

## Client Support

Currently, most MCP clients only support tools. Sampling support is expected to be added to:
- Claude Desktop (future versions)
- Custom MCP clients
- Advanced development environments

## Getting Started

1. **Enable Sampling:** Set `XCODEBUILDMCP_ENABLE_SAMPLING=true`
2. **Check Client Support:** Verify your MCP client supports sampling
3. **Configure Permissions:** Set up appropriate user consent mechanisms
4. **Monitor Activity:** Review sampling logs and activities

## Feedback and Development

As sampling capabilities are developed, we welcome feedback on:
- Desired autonomous behaviors
- Safety and security requirements
- User experience preferences
- Integration patterns

Please file issues or discussions on the GitHub repository to help shape the sampling implementation.
