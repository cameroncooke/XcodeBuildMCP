# XcodeBuildMCP Tools Reference

This document provides a comprehensive list of all 54 tools available in XcodeBuildMCP, organized by functionality.

## MCP Resources

For clients that support MCP resources (VS Code, Claude Code, Claude Desktop), XcodeBuildMCP also provides efficient URI-based data access:

| Resource URI | Description | Replaces Tool |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| `mcp://xcodebuild/simulators` | Available iOS simulators with UUIDs and states | `list_sims` |

**Note**: Resources provide the same data as their corresponding tools but through efficient URI access. XcodeBuildMCP automatically detects client capabilities and filters out redundant tools when resources are available.

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Common Workflows

1. **iOS Simulator Development**:
   ```
   discover_projs → list_schems_ws → list_sims → build_sim_name_ws → install_app_sim → launch_app_sim
   ```

2. **macOS Development**:
   ```
   discover_projs → list_schems_ws → build_mac_ws → launch_mac_app
   ```

3. **Testing Workflow**:
   ```
   discover_projs → list_schems_ws → test_sim_name_ws (or test_macos_ws)
   ```

4. **Swift Package Development**:
   ```
   swift_package_build → swift_package_test → swift_package_run
   ```

### Parameter Requirements

Many tools require specific parameters:
- **Workspace tools**: `workspacePath`
- **Project tools**: `projectPath`
- **Scheme-based tools**: `scheme`
- **Simulator tools**: `simulatorName` or `simulatorId`
- **Device tools**: `deviceId`
- **App tools**: `appPath` or `bundleId`

### Environment Variables

Tools can be selectively enabled using environment variables:
- Individual tools: `XCODEBUILDMCP_TOOL_<TOOL_NAME>=true`
- Tool groups: `XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_<GROUP_NAME>=true`
- Debug mode: `XCODEBUILDMCP_DEBUG=true`

## Notes

- All tools use Zod schema validation for parameters
- Error handling is standardized across all tools
- Tools requiring write operations are marked with `isWriteTool: true`
- UI automation tools use precise coordinates from `describe_ui`, not screenshots
- Device operations require proper code signing configuration in Xcode
