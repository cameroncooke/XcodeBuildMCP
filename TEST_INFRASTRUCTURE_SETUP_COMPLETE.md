# Test Infrastructure Setup Complete

## Summary
Successfully set up complete test infrastructure in canonical implementation at `/Volumes/Developer/XcodeBuildMCP-main/`.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Package.json Updates
- ✅ Added test scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:ui`, `test:coverage`
- ✅ Added Vitest dependencies: `vitest@^3.2.4`, `@vitest/ui@^3.2.4`, `@vitest/coverage-v8@^3.2.4`
- ✅ Added Playwright dependency: `playwright@^1.53.0`
- ✅ Added missing `reloaderoo@^1.0.1` dependency

### 2. Vitest Configuration
- ✅ Created `vitest.config.ts` with:
  - Node environment configuration
  - TypeScript ES modules support
  - Test timeout settings (30s)
  - Coverage configuration with v8 provider
  - Import alias handling for .js extensions in TypeScript

### 3. Test Directory Structure
- ✅ Created `tests-vitest/` directory
- ✅ Created `tests-vitest/helpers/` for shared utilities
- ✅ Created `tests-vitest/src/tools/` for tool-specific tests

### 4. Test Helpers
- ✅ Created `vitest-tool-helpers.ts` with:
  - `callToolHandler()` function for consistent tool testing
  - `createMockChildProcess()` for mocking command execution
  - Error handling and response formatting utilities

### 5. Infrastructure Testing
- ✅ Created basic infrastructure test (`infrastructure.test.ts`)
- ✅ Verified all test commands work:
  - `npm test` - Run all tests ✅
  - `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode ✅
  - `npm run test:ui` - UI mode ✅
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Coverage reporting ✅

### 6. Dependency Installation
- ✅ All dependencies installed successfully (533 packages)
- ✅ Build process verified to work with new dependencies
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Test Results
```
✓ tests-vitest/infrastructure.test.ts (3 tests) 4ms

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  3 passed (3)
  Duration  111ms
```

## Ready for Phase 2
The test infrastructure is now fully operational and ready for the migration of 700+ tests from the plugin implementation. The foundation supports:

- **Native TypeScript ES modules** with proper import handling
- **Deterministic test execution** with vmThreads pool
- **Complete coverage reporting** with v8 provider
- **Mock utilities** for command execution testing
- **Consistent response validation** patterns

## File Locations
- Package configuration: `/Volumes/Developer/XcodeBuildMCP-main/package.json`
- Vitest config: `/Volumes/Developer/XcodeBuildMCP-main/vitest.config.ts`
- Test helpers: `/Volumes/Developer/XcodeBuildMCP-main/tests-vitest/helpers/vitest-tool-helpers.ts`
- Test directory: `/Volumes/Developer/XcodeBuildMCP-main/tests-vitest/`

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Test dependencies added to canonical package.json
- ✅ Test scripts functional (npm test runs without import errors)
- ✅ Vitest configuration properly set up
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Basic test infrastructure operational
- ✅ Build process unaffected
- ✅ Foundation ready for 700+ test migration

**PHASE 1 COMPLETE - INFRASTRUCTURE READY FOR TEST MIGRATION**
