# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help improve XcodeBuildMCP.

## Local development setup

### Prerequisites

In addition to the prerequisites mentioned in the [Getting started](README.md/#getting-started) section of the README, you will also need:

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm

#### Optional: Enabling UI Automation

When running locally, you'll need to install Facebook's idb tools:

```bash
# Install idb_companion (required for UI automation)
brew tap facebook/fb
brew install idb-companion
```

Install fb-idb Python package:

```bash
pip install fb-idb==1.1.7
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   node build/index.js
   ```

### Configure your MCP client

To configure your MCP client to use your local XcodeBuildMCP server you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path_to/XcodeBuildMCP/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

You can use MCP Inspector via:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

## Making changes

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch

3. Add proper parameter validation and error handling

## Testing

1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Test your changes with MCP Inspector
3. Verify tools work correctly with different MCP clients

## Submitting

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues (use `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix)
