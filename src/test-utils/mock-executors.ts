/**
 * Mock Executors for Testing - Dependency Injection Architecture
 *
 * This module provides mock implementations of CommandExecutor and FileSystemExecutor
 * for testing purposes. These mocks are completely isolated from production dependencies
 * to avoid import chains that could trigger native module loading issues in test environments.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: These are EXACT copies of the mock functions originally in utils/command.js
 * to ensure zero behavioral changes during the file reorganization.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Providing mock command execution for tests
 * - Providing mock file system operations for tests
 * - Maintaining exact behavior compatibility with original implementations
 * - Avoiding any dependencies on production logging or instrumentation
