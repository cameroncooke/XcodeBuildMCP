## Overview

XcodeBuildMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Xcode operations as tools and resources for AI assistants and other MCP clients. Built with a modern plugin architecture, it provides a comprehensive set of self-contained tools organized into workflow-based directories, plus MCP resources for efficient data access, enabling programmatic interaction with Xcode projects, simulators, devices, and Swift packages through a standardized interface.

## Why?

The XcodeBuild MCP tool exists primarily to streamline and standardise interaction between AI agents and Xcode projects. By providing dedicated tools for common Xcode operations, it removes reliance on manual or potentially incorrect command-line invocations.

This ensures a reliable and efficient development process, allowing agents to seamlessly leverage Xcode's capabilities while reducing the risk of configuration errors.

Critically, this MCP enables AI agents to independently validate code changes by building projects, inspecting errors, and iterating autonomously. In contrast to user-driven tools like Sweetpad, XcodeBuild MCP empowers agents to automate these workflows effectively.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.5 or later
- Xcode 16.x or later
- Node 18.x or later

### Configure your MCP client

#### Quick install

For a quick install, you can use the following links:

- [![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IHhjb2RlYnVpbGRtY3BAbGF0ZXN0In0%3D)
- [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF" alt="Install in VS Code">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22xcodebuildmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D)
- [<img alt="Install in VS Code Insiders" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22xcodebuildmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

#### Manual installation

Configure your MCP client (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Desktop, Claude Code etc.) to use the XcodeBuildMCP server by ammending your client application's MCP configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Alternative installation method using mise

Alternatively, you can use XcodeBuildMCP without a specific installation of Node.js by using `mise` to install it:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install mise

# Other installation methods
# See https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html
```

Then configure your MCP client to use mise to install XcodeBuildMCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "mise",
      "args": [
        "x",
        "npm:xcodebuildmcp@1.11.2",
        "--",
        "xcodebuildmcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using mise avoid using the @latest tag as mise will cache the package and may not update to the latest version automatically, instead prefer an explicit version number.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that XcodeBuildMCP will request xcodebuild to skip macro validation. This is to avoid errors when building projects that use Swift Macros. 

#### Installing via Smithery

To install XcodeBuildMCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP --client claude
```

#### MCP Compatibility

XcodeBuildMCP supports both MCP tools, resources and sampling. At time of writing the following editors have varying levels of MCP feature support:

| Editor | Tools | Resources | Samplng |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **VS Code** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Cursor** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 
| **Windsurf** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Claude Desktop** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Incremental build support

XcodeBuildMCP includes experimental support for incremental builds. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:

To enable incremental builds, set the `INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:

Example MCP client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED": "true"
      }        
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that incremental builds support is currently highly experimental and your mileage may vary. Please report any issues you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP/issues).

## Dynamic Tools

XcodeBuildMCP supports dynamic tool loading to optimize context window usage in AI assistants. This feature is particularly useful for managing the extensive toolset (80+ tools) that XcodeBuildMCP provides.

### What is Dynamic Tools?

By default, XcodeBuildMCP loads all available tools at startup (Static Mode), which provides immediate access to the complete toolset but uses a larger context window. Dynamic Tools mode solves this by:

1. **Starting minimal**: Only essential tools like `discover_tools` and `discover_projs` are available initially
2. **AI-powered discovery**: When an AI agent identifies XcodeBuildMCP can help with development tasks, it automatically uses the `discover_tools` tool
3. **Intelligent loading**: The server uses an LLM call to identify the most relevant workflow group and dynamically loads only those tools
4. **Context efficiency**: Reduces the initial context footprint from 80+ tools to just 2 discovery tools while maintaining full functionality

### How to Enable Dynamic Tools

To enable dynamic tools, set the `XCODEBUILDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLS` environment variable to `true`:

Example MCP client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "XCODEBUILDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLS": "true"
      }        
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Example

Once enabled, AI agents automatically discover and load relevant tools based on context. For example, when you mention working on an iOS app or the agent detects iOS development tasks in your workspace, it will automatically use the `discover_tools` tool to load the appropriate simulator and project tools needed for your workflow.

### Client Compatibility

Dynamic Tools requires MCP clients that support **MCP Sampling** for the AI-powered tool discovery to function:

| Editor | Dynamic Tools Support |
|--------|----------------------|
| **VS Code** | ✅ |
| **Cursor** | ❌ (No MCP Sampling) |
| **Windsurf** | ❌ (No MCP Sampling) |
| **Claude Code** | ❌ (No MCP Sampling) |
| **Claude Desktop** | ❌ (No MCP Sampling) |

> [!NOTE]
> For clients that don't support MCP Sampling, XcodeBuildMCP will automatically fall back to Static Mode, loading all tools at startup regardless of the `XCODEBUILDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLS` setting.

## Code Signing for Device Deployment

For device deployment features to work, code signing must be properly configured in Xcode **before** using XcodeBuildMCP device tools:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your project target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Configure "Automatically manage signing" and select your development team
5. Ensure a valid provisioning profile is selected

> **Note**: XcodeBuildMCP cannot configure code signing automatically. This initial setup must be done once in Xcode, after which the MCP device tools can build, install, and test apps on physical devices.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with XcodeBuildMCP, the doctor tool can help identify the problem by providing detailed information about your environment and dependencies.

### Doctor Tool

The doctor tool is a standalone utility that checks your system configuration and reports on the status of all dependencies required by XcodeBuildMCP. It's particularly useful when reporting issues.

```bash
# Run the doctor tool using npx
npx --package xcodebuildmcp@latest xcodebuildmcp-doctor
```

The doctor tool will output comprehensive information about:

- System and Node.js environment
- Xcode installation and configuration
- Required dependencies (xcodebuild, AXe, etc.)
- Environment variables affecting XcodeBuildMCP
- Feature availability status

When reporting issues on GitHub, please include the full output from the doctor tool to help with troubleshooting.

## Privacy

This project uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error monitoring and diagnostics. Sentry helps us track issues, crashes, and unexpected errors to improve the reliability and stability of XcodeBuildMCP.

### What is sent to Sentry?
- Only error-level logs and diagnostic information are sent to Sentry by default.
- Error logs may include details such as error messages, stack traces, and (in some cases) file paths or project names. You can review the sources in this repository to see exactly what is logged.

### Opting Out of Sentry
- If you do not wish to send error logs to Sentry, you can opt out by setting the environment variable `SENTRY_DISABLED=true`.

Example MCP client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SENTRY_DISABLED": "true"
      }        
    }
  }
}
```
